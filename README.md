Fitbit Web APIとPHP7.0による心拍数の取得.  ソースコードの動作方法はQiita（https://qiita.com/aiba-akihito/items/e945967981c7d7eb11c8 ）にまとめてあります.


Extended the code of Aiba Akihito (code-of-design) to add additional API functionality (Steps, Distance, Body Fat, and Weight) as well as some tweaks. The original code was great and easy to work with. All thanks goes to Aiba Akihito.
